Everything is the same as in the original llama.cpp but Starvector support has been added!

While in development, come back later... 

Which is already supported:

|  | Starvector-1b          |Starvector-8b           |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  Quantization     | ✅ | ❌ |
|  Inference     | ? (I haven't tested it yet, but theoretically it should work)| ❌ |
